          <p>
            Most AI research tools promise perfect analysis but deliver overconfident verdicts with no explanation. They treat every paper the same way and hide their reasoning behind black-box algorithms. You&apos;re expected to trust the output without understanding how it arrived there.
          </p>

          <p>
            We built Syllogos differently. We admit when we&apos;re uncertain, show our confidence levels for every claim, and explain our reasoning with specific evidence. Our framework adapts to your paper&apos;s academic field—a medical study gets different scrutiny than a theoretical essay.
          </p>

          <p>
            We surveyed 20+ researchers before building this tool. They told us they needed transparency over confidence, and field-specific evaluation over generic scores. We built Syllogos because we understand that AI should support expert judgment, not replace it.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our commitment: We never invent citations, never hide uncertainty, and always show confidence percentages. If we can&apos;t reliably assess something, we say so. You deserve AI that shows its work, admits its limits, and respects your expertise.
          </p>
