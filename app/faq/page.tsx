    question: "How does Syllogos analyze research papers?",
    answer: "Syllogos uses advanced AI to evaluate papers across multiple dimensions including methodological rigor, data transparency, source quality, and bias detection. Our adaptive framework adjusts evaluation criteria based on the paper's field and document type."
  },
  {
    question: "What makes your analysis transparent?",
    answer: "Every assessment includes confidence scores (0-100%) showing our certainty level. We provide specific evidence citations and explain our reasoning. If we're uncertain about something, we explicitly say so rather than making overconfident claims."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I analyze papers from any academic field?",
    answer: "Yes! Our system recognizes 8 major academic fields (natural sciences, engineering, medical, social sciences, humanities, etc.) and adapts the evaluation framework accordingly. A medical RCT is assessed differently than a qualitative ethnography."
  },
  {
    question: "How accurate is the bias detection?",
    answer: "We detect 8 types of bias with varying confidence levels. Our system flags potential issues but encourages expert judgment. We're transparent about limitations and provide evidence for each bias claim."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you store my analyzed papers?",
    answer: "We only store metadata necessary for your account (titles, analysis results). The actual paper content is processed but not permanently stored. See our Privacy Policy for details."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I export analysis results?",
    answer: "Yes (Pro plan and above). Export comprehensive reports as PDF including all credibility scores, bias assessments, and evidence. Perfect for sharing with colleagues or grant reviewers."
